/* augmented assignment operators = used to replace a statement
 *                                  where an operator takes
 *                                  a variable as one of its
 *                                  arguments and then assigns
 *                                  the result back to the
 *                                  same variable
 * int x = 2;
 * x = x + 2;
 * x+= 2;
 *
 * augmented operators are for an example:
 * +=
 * -=
 * *=
 * /=
 * %=
